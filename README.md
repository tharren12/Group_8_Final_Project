# Segment 1 Deliverable

## Communication Protocol
For this project we will be using Slack in conjunction with GitHub as our communication protocols. We will using Slack for all our discussions. GitHub will be used for the technical collaboration. Any changes will be communicated through Slack before they are committed and pushed to the GitHub repository. Jupiter Notebook and Google Collab will also be used at different stages in the project. 

## Project Management 
The team will be using Jira as a tracking and collaboration tool for this project. It will be used to create a roadmap, timetable, direction and list of tasks. The tool will also be used to show assigned tasks for each member of the team.

We should be able to see ongoing or finished tasks, the time spent on these tasks, and this will make it easier to stay on track for the entire project life cycle.
